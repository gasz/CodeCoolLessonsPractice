~ 1. Write a loop that iterates through numbers from 0 to 100 and prints each number.
~ 2. Write a loop that iterates through numbers from 0 to 100 and prints the sum of the numbers.
~ 3. Write a loop that calculates the Fibonacci numbers under 100 and prints each one of them.
~ 4. Write a loop that iterates through an array of strings and prints each one of them. Array: {"moo","bark","meow","rawr","screech","chirp","growl","buzz","quack"}
~ 5. Write a loop that iterates through the last array and adds each element to an ArrayList.
~ 6. Write a loop that iterates through that last ArrayList and collects the first letter of each element to a string. Print it after its done.
~ 7. Write an algorithm to find the longest word in the last ArrayList and print it.
~ 8. Write an algorithm that creates a matrix with 10 rows and 10 columns and fills it with numbers. 
    - 8.1 Where both the row and the column index is even put 0. 
    - 8.2 Where one of them is odd put 1. 
    - 8.3 Where both of them is odd put 2.
    - 8.4 Print the matrix to show rows and columns accurately.
~ 9. Refactor your code to be CLEAN! Separate it into functions. Make sure to use informative and proper variable and function names!
~ 10. Extra: Refactor your code into separate classes. Instantiate every class in Main and run their functions. (módosítva)
